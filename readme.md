#Messenger web application

This application was created as a course project by Goncharov Dmitry.
The back-end part is written in the C# programming language. I used 
ASP.NET MVC Framework, which makes it possible to create applications,
which implement the model-view-controller pattern. The front-end uses
JavaScript, particularly its jQuery library.
